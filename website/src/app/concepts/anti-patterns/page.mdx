## ❌ Anti-Patterns to Avoid

- Overengineering: abstractions that solve no real problem
- Clean Layer Hell: files with only `.index.ts` and no logic
- Reusing everything just to “not repeat”
- App state leaking into domain logic
- Global “utils” with unclear boundaries
- Putting all logic in the UI layer
