## 🏢 Structure, Folders & Boundaries

- `/features/*` → domain-based folders
- `/shared/*` → common utilities, components, hooks
- `/app/` → root composition, routes, config
- `/services/` → API, side effects, logic

📌 Use tools like **Turborepo**, **Nx**, **ESLint boundaries**, and **Storybook** to enforce architecture in practice.
