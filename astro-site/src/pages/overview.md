## 🏗️ What is Front-End Architecture?

Architecture in frontend isn't just about folder structure.  
It’s about **how your app evolves, scales, and stays resilient** as complexity and teams grow.

### Key questions:

- How do you separate concerns?
- How does data flow?
- Where does business logic live?
- Can this scale across squads and products?
- Can this be tested, extended, or reused?
