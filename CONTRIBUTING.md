# Contributing

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! ✨

This project follows the [Awesome Manifesto](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome/blob/main/awesome.md).
Please keep the following in mind when submitting pull requests.

## Ground Rules

1. **Quality over quantity** – one excellent link beats ten mediocre ones.
2. **Alphabetical order** – place new items alphabetically within a section.
3. **Description ≤ 100 characters** – short, direct, sentence-case.
4. **No duplicates** – search to make sure the link isn't already listed.
5. **Stable resources only** – avoid dead links, WIP repos, or private pages.
6. **Add one link per PR** – easier to review, merge, and revert if needed.
7. **Respect licensing** – share only content that is freely accessible.

## How to Submit a PR

# 1. Fork and clone
$ git clone your-fork-url && cd awesome-front-end-architecture

# 3. Add your link in the correct section / position
# 4. Commit with a clear message
